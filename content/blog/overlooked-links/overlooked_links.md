This is a list of high-quality online resources that are good to know about but hard to stumble across.

Maybe they aren’t maintained often but remain relevant. Maybe they’re personal blogs with good content but few keywords.

Whatever the reason, this is their place to shine.

## Rules for Inclusion

1. Only free resources.
2. Some degree of obscurity required. They shouldn’t be the first thing you see when you search something like “biology.”
3. No resources for which strictly-better alternatives exist.

I’m obsessed with puzzlehunts and have therefore collected a disproportionate number of websites on them.

Let’s define a “puzzlehunt” as any self-contained group of sequential puzzles that don’t always fall into well-established formats like Sudoku or [Masyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masyu).

- [Introduction to Puzzlehunts](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts)
