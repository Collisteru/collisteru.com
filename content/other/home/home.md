# Collisteru

Welcome to Collisteru's site! I'm a computer programmer, writer, and
general creator. My STEM interests include AI, functional programming,
web design, and math (especially analysis). On the humanities side, I
love classical music, history, pre-modern art, indie video games,
webcomics, Christianity, Buddhism, and philosophy.

TODO: Maybe include more images or something of interest here? The problem is that I just don't have that much material right now.
