Welcome to Collisteru's little blog and portfolio site! It's inspired in part by late 90s / early 2000s web design and in part by 19th century English typesetting. I hope you enjoy your stay!

- I'm a computer programmer, writer, and general creator. 
- Professionally, I'm a Computer Science + Applied Math undergraduate at the University of Colorado.  
- I work as an AI researcher in industry. I think AI is the most important technology of the century so far and am dedicated to making it safe and effective.
